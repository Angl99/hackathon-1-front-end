## Project Defintion
This project is a full-stack application designed to connect community members for food donation events based on mutual aid principles.

### Features:
 - **Users can register, log in, and update their profiles.**
 - **Users can view a list of upcoming food donation events in their community.**
- **Each event displays details like location, time, description, and contact information.**
- **Users can create new food donation events, specifying details.**
- **Users can mark themselves as attending an event (RSVP).**

### Technology Stack:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication 


## Setup Instructions:
### Frontend:

 - Clone this repository.
 - Install dependencies: npm install
 - Start the development server: npm start (This will typically run the app on http://localhost:3000/)

### Backend:


- Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.
- Install dependencies: npm install (in the backend directory)
- Start the server: node server.js (This will typically start the server on a specified port)

---

### Additional Notes:
 - Configuration details for the backend server (database connection, etc.) might be stored in a separate environment variable file.
- Authentication setup with Firebase or a similar service will require configuration details specific to your chosen provider.
 - Remember to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow communication between the frontend and backend if they are deployed on different domains.

### Deployment:
 - This README provides instructions for local development. Deployment instructions for specific hosting platforms will vary.
